I am a designer with specialization in motion graphics and illustration. I have diverse multimedia skills that make for streamlined creative problem solving. My experience spans private and public sector.

I love motion graphics because it is an art form that allows for innumerable creative possibilities. You are not limited to a two dimensional plane, plus you can add music, footage, and special effects. It takes design to the next level of viewer engagement. I enjoy facilitating this creative process. Watching projects grow from a simple idea sketched on paper into a full-fledged digital animation is extremely fulfilling.
